INTRODUCTION 
In the modern digital era, web applications and software systems have become integral to various aspects of daily life, providing users with interactive and engaging experiences. This final year project focuses on the development of a robust application utilizing Java, Maven, and MySQL technologies, with additional functionalities encompassing user registration, authentication through OTP (One Time Password), and comprehensive administrative controls.
The application features a login and registration system where users can securely register and authenticate using OTP verification, ensuring a high level of security and reliability. Users are provided with a dynamic and engaging interface, designed using Java Swing and AWT (Abstract Window Toolkit), which allows them to participate in a quiz game. This interactive quiz game not only offers an entertaining user experience but also serves as an educational tool, enhancing users' knowledge in various domains.
On the administrative side, the application offers robust features enabling administrators to manage and monitor user activities efficiently. Admins can access detailed reports of each user's performance, including their quiz scores and participation history. Furthermore, the system supports the exportation of user scores and details into new Excel files, facilitating easy data analysis and record-keeping.

Purpose of the project:
The purpose of this project is to develop a Java-based application with Maven and MySQL integration, offering secure user authentication via OTP, interactive quiz functionality for users, and comprehensive administrative features for monitoring user activity and exporting data for analysis.
Current and Proposed System:
